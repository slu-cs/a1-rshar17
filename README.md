Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier to find.
    - I can't find who works at the BoE and how to email them.
    - Forms for registration and absentee are mentioned but not linked.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the registration deadlines for 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the early voting dates for 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The Guide page is lengthy. It would be nice to split this up.
    - Dates & deadlines would be well suited to present in tables.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - Styling needs work.
    - Centered list items don't look right at all.
    - The navbar doesn't have active-link highlighting, so visitors can't keep track of where they are.
